<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Andy David Zurita García. I'm twenty years old and I come from Mexico. I've been living in Montreal for almost six years now. It's been quite a journey adapting to a new country and culture, but I've found it incredibly rewarding.</p>

<p>About two months ago, I decided to dive into the world of programming, and I've been making significant progress ever since. It's been a passion of mine for years, and I'm thrilled to finally be pursuing it more formally.</p>

<p>Studying programming has been both challenging and exciting. I've been taking online courses and dedicating a lot of time to self-directed learning. With the support of my family and my own determination, I've been able to improve my skills and expand my knowledge in a relatively short amount of time.</p>
  <p>Beyond programming, I love exploring the vibrant city of Montreal. There's always something new to discover, whether it's a hidden café or a beautiful park. I also enjoy spending time outdoors, hiking in the nearby mountains or biking along the river.</p>
  
  <p>I'm incredibly excited about the opportunities that lie ahead in the field of programming. My dream is to work on innovative projects that have a positive impact on the world. With hard work and perseverance, I know I can achieve my goals and make a difference in the tech industry.
